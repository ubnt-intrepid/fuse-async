`polyfuse` is a library for implementing filesystems based on [Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace) in Rust.

The goal of this project is to provide a Rust FUSE library that has a high affinity with the `async`/`.await` syntax stabilized in Rust 1.39.

## Installation

Add a dependency to your package using [`cargo-edit`](https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit) as follows:

```shell-session
$ cargo add polyfuse
```

To run FUSE daemon, it is necessary to choose appropriate supporting package according to the asynchronous runtime to be used.
Currently, `polyfuse` only provides a support for the [`tokio`](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio) and adding support for [`async-std`](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std) is a future work.

## Platform Requirements

Currently, `polyfuse` only supports the Linux platforms with the FUSE ABI version is 7.23 or higher.
The required kernel version is Linux 3.15 or later.

> Adding support for other Unix platform running FUSE (FreeBSD, macOS, and so on) is a future work.

In order to establish the connection with the FUSE kernel driver, the command
`fusermount` must be installed on the platform where the filesystem runs.
This binary is typically including in the fuse package provided by the distribution's package system.

On Debian/Ubuntu or other APT based distributions:

```shell-session
$ sudo apt-get install fuse
```

On Fedora/RHEL or other RPM based distributions:

```shell-session
$ sudo dnf install fuse
```

On Arch Linux or other Pacman based distributions:

```shell-session
$ sudo pacman -S fuse2
```
